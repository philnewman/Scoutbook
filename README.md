Wordpress plugin to read data from Scoutbook(tm)

Install via WP admin plugins page.  Once installed, go to settings and add unit ID, login and pwd.

This plugin will login and scrape scoutbook.com's roster page. Running the input_from_scoutbook.php file after installing and configuring will read and import from scoutbook.   The result will be placed into 2 custom post types: scouts, adults.  These can be viewed with Wordpress dashboard.  The plugin provides for 6 shortcodes:
[patrol_list]
[scoutbook_scoutbyrank]
[scoutbook_patroldirectory]
[scoutmasterdirectory]
[committeedirectory]
[meritbadgecounselordirectory]

Running the input_from_scoutbook.php file after installing and configuring will read and import from scoutbook.  


I have no affilitation with scoutbook - but created this due to lack of an API.

YIS!
